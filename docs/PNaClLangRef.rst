Introduction
============

This document is a reference manual for the PNaCl bitcode format. It describes
the bitcode on a *semantic* level; the physical encoding level will be described
elsewhere. For the purpose of this document, the textual form of LLVM IR is
used to describe instructions and other bitcode constructs.

Since the PNaCl bitcode is based to a large extent on LLVM IR, many sections
in this document point to a relevant section of the LLVM language reference
manual. Only the changes, restrictions and variations specific to PNaCl are
described - full semantic descriptions are not duplicated from the LLVM
reference manual.

High Level Structure
====================

A PNaCl portable executable ("pexe" in short) is a single LLVM IR module.

.. _linkagetypes:

Linkage Types
-------------

`LLVM LangRef: Linkage Types <LangRef.html#linkage>`_

The linkage types supported by PNaCl bitcode are ``internal`` and ``external``.
A single function in the pexe, named ``_start``, has the linkage type
``external``. All the other functions and globals have the linkage type
``internal``.

Calling Conventions
-------------------

`LLVM LangRef: Calling Conventions <LangRef.html#callingconv>`_

The only calling convention supported by PNaCl bitcode is ``ccc`` - the C
calling convention.

Visibility Styles
-----------------

`LLVM LangRef: Visibility Styles <LangRef.html#visibilitystyles>`_

PNaCl bitcode does not support visibility styles.

Global Values
-------------

The following restrictions apply to both global variables and functions.

These attributes are disallowed:

* ``addrspace``, ``section``, ``unnamed_addr``.

.. _globalvariables:

Global Variables
----------------

`LLVM LangRef: Global Variables <LangRef.html#globalvars>`_

Restrictions on global variables:

* PNaCl bitcode does not support TLS models.
* Restrictions on :ref:`linkage types <linkagetypes>`.
* The ``externally_initialized`` attribute is not supported.

Every global variable must have an initializer. Each initializer must be
either a *SimpleElement* or a *CompoundElement*, defined as follows.

A *SimpleElement* is one of the following:

1) An i8 array literal or ``zeroinitializer``:

.. code-block:: llvm

     [SIZE x i8] c"DATA"
     [SIZE x i8] zeroinitializer

2) A reference to a *GlobalValue* (a function or global variable) with an
   optional 32-bit byte offset added to it (the addend, which may be
   negative):

.. code-block:: llvm

     ptrtoint (TYPE* @GLOBAL to i32)
     add (i32 ptrtoint (TYPE* @GLOBAL to i32), i32 ADDEND)

A *CompoundElement* is a unnamed, packed struct containing more than one
*SimpleElement*.

Functions
---------

`LLVM LangRef: Functions <LangRef.html#functionstructure>`_

The restrictions on :ref:`linkage types <linkagetypes>`, calling conventions
and visibility styles apply to functions. In addition, the following are
not supported for functions:

* Function attributes (either for the the function itself, its parameters or its
  return type).
* Garbage collector name (``gc``).
* Functions with a variable number of arguments (*vararg*).
* Alignment (``align``).

Aliases
-------

`LLVM LangRef: Aliases <LangRef.html#langref_aliases>`_

PNaCl bitcode does not support aliases.

Named Metadata
--------------

`LLVM LangRef: Named Metadata <LangRef.html#namedmetadatastructure>`_

While PNaCl bitcode has provisions for debugging metadata, it is not considered
part of the stable ABI. It exists for tool support and should not appear in
distributed pexes.

Other kinds of LLVM metadata are not supported.

Module-Level Inline Assembly
----------------------------

`LLVM LangRef: Module-Level Inline Assembly <LangRef.html#moduleasm>`_

PNaCl bitcode does not support inline assembly.

Volatile Memory Accesses
------------------------

`LLVM LangRef: Volatile Memory Accesses <LangRef.html#volatile>`_

PNaCl bitcode does not support volatile memory accesses. The ``volatile``
attribute on loads and stores is not supported. See the
`PNaCl Developer's Guide <PNaClDeveloperGuide.html>`_ for more details.

Memory Model for Concurrent Operations
--------------------------------------

`LLVM LangRef: Memory Model for Concurrent Operations <LangRef.html#memmodel>`_

See the `PNaCl Developer's Guide <PNaClDeveloperGuide.html>`_ for more details.

Atomic Memory Ordering Constraints
----------------------------------

`LLVM LangRef: Atomic Memory Ordering Constraints <LangRef.html#ordering>`_

PNaCl bitcode currently supports sequential consistency only, through its
`atomic intrinsics`_. See the
`PNaCl Developer's Guide <PNaClDeveloperGuide.html>`_ for more details.

Fast-Math Flags
---------------

`LLVM LangRef: Fast-Math Flags <LangRef.html#fastmath>`_

Fast-math mode is not currently supported by the PNaCl bitcode.

Type System
===========

`LLVM LangRef: Type System <LangRef.html#typesystem>`_

The LLVM types allowed in PNaCl bitcode are restricted, as follows:

Scalar types
------------

* The only scalar types allowed are integer, float, double and void.

  * The only integer sizes allowed are i1, i8, i16, i32 and i64.
  * The only integer sizes allowed for function arguments and function return
    values are i32 and i64.

Array and struct types
----------------------

Array and struct types are only allowed in
:ref:`global variable initializers <globalvariables>`.

.. _pointertypes:

Pointer types
-------------

Only the following pointer types are allowed:

* Pointers to valid PNaCl bitcode scalar types, as specified above.
* Pointers to functions.

In addition, the address space for all pointers must be 0.

A pointer is *inherent* when it represents the return value of an ``alloca``
instruction, or is an address of a global value.

A pointer is *normalized* if it's either:

* *inherent*
* Is the return value of a ``bitcast`` instruction.
* Is the return value of a ``inttoptr`` instruction.

Note: the size of a pointer in PNaCl is 32 bits.

Undefined Values
----------------

`LLVM LangRef: Undefined Values <LangRef.html#undefvalues>`_

``undef`` is only allowed within functions, not in global variable initializers.

Constant Expressions
--------------------

`LLVM LangRef: Constant Expressions <LangRef.html#constantexprs>`_

Constant expressions are only allowed in
:ref:`global variable initializers <globalvariables>`.

Other Values
============

Metadata Nodes and Metadata Strings
-----------------------------------

`LLVM LangRef: Metadata Nodes and Metadata Strings <LangRef.html#metadata>`_

While PNaCl bitcode has provisions for debugging metadata, it is not considered
part of the stable ABI. It exists for tool support and should not appear in
distributed pexes.

Other kinds of LLVM metadata are not supported.

Intrinsic Global Variables
==========================

`LLVM LangRef: Intrinsic Global Variables <LangRef.html#intrinsicglobalvariables>`_

PNaCl bitcode does not support intrinsic global variables.

Instruction Reference
=====================

List of allowed instructions
----------------------------

This is a list of LLVM instructions supported by PNaCl bitcode. Where
applicable, PNaCl-specific restrictions are provided.

The following attributes are disallowed for all instructions:

* ``nsw`` and ``nuw``
* ``exact``

Only the LLVM instructions listed here are supported by PNaCl bitcode.

* ``ret``
* ``br``
* ``switch``

  i1 values are disallowed for ``switch``.

* ``add``, ``sub``, ``mul``, ``shl``,  ``udiv``, ``sdiv``, ``urem``, ``srem``,
  ``lshr``, ``ashr``

  These arithmetic operations are disallowed i1.

  Integer division (``udiv``, ``sdiv``, ``urem``, ``srem``) by zero is
  guaranteed to trap in PNaCl bitcode.

* ``and``
* ``or``
* ``xor``
* ``fadd``
* ``fsub``
* ``fmul``
* ``fdiv``
* ``frem``
* ``alloca``

  See :ref:`alloca instructions <allocainst>`.

* ``load``, ``store``

  The pointer argument of these instructions must be a *normalized* pointer
  (see :ref:`pointer types <pointertypes>`). The ``volatile`` and ``atomic``
  attributes are not supported. Loads and stores of the type ``i1`` are not
  supported.

  These instructions must use ``align 1`` on integer memory accesses.

* ``trunc``
* ``zext``
* ``sext``
* ``fptrunc``
* ``fpext``
* ``fptoui``
* ``fptosi``
* ``uitofp``
* ``sitofp``

* ``ptrtoint``

  The pointer argument of a ``ptrtoint`` instruction must be a *normalized*
  pointer (see :ref:`pointer types <pointertypes>`) and the integer argument
  must be an i32.

* ``inttoptr``

  The integer argument of a ``inttoptr`` instruction must be an i32.

* ``bitcast``

  The pointer argument of a ``bitcast`` instruction must be a *inherent* pointer
  (see :ref:`pointer types <pointertypes>`).

* ``icmp``
* ``fcmp``
* ``phi``
* ``select``
* ``call``

.. _allocainst:

``alloca``
----------

The only allowed type for ``alloca`` instructions in PNaCl bitcode is i8. The
size argument must be an i32. For example:

.. code-block:: llvm

    %buf = alloca i8, i32 8, align 4

Intrinsic Functions
===================

`LLVM LangRef: Intrinsic Functions <LangRef.html#intrinsics>`_

List of allowed intrinsics
--------------------------

The only intrinsics supported by PNaCl bitcode are the following.

* ``llvm.memcpy``
* ``llvm.memmove``
* ``llvm.memset``

  These intrinsics are only supported with an i32 ``len`` argument.

* ``llvm.bswap``

  The overloaded ``llvm.bswap`` intrinsic is only supported with the following
  argument types: i16, i32, i64 (the types supported by C-style GCC builtins).

* ``llvm.ctlz``
* ``llvm.cttz``
* ``llvm.ctpop``

  The overloaded llvm.ctlz, llvm.cttz, and llvm.ctpop intrinsics are only
  supported with the i32 and i64 argument types (the types supported by
  C-style GCC builtins).

* ``llvm.sqrt``

  The overloaded ``llvm.sqrt`` intrinsic is only supported for float
  and double arguments types. Unlike the standard LLVM intrinsic,
  PNaCl guarantees that llvm.sqrt returns a QNaN for values less than -0.0.

* ``llvm.stacksave``
* ``llvm.stackrestore``

  These intrinsics are used to implement language features like scoped automatic
  variable sized arrays in C99. ``llvm.stacksave`` returns a value that
  represents the current state of the stack. This value may only be used as the
  argument to ``llvm.stackrestore``, which restores the stack to the given
  state.

* ``llvm.trap``

  This intrinsic is lowered to a target dependent trap instruction, which aborts
  execution.

* ``llvm.nacl.read.tp``

  See :ref:`thread pointer related intrinsics <threadpointerintrinsics>`.

* ``llvm.nacl.longjmp``
* ``llvm.nacl.setjmp``

  See :ref:`Setjmp and Longjmp <setjmplongjmp>`.

.. _atomic intrinsics:

* ``llvm.nacl.atomic.store``
* ``llvm.nacl.atomic.load``
* ``llvm.nacl.atomic.rmw``
* ``llvm.nacl.atomic.cmpxchg``
* ``llvm.nacl.atomic.fence``

  See :ref:`atomic intrinsics <atomicintrinsics>`.

.. _threadpointerintrinsics:

Thread pointer related intrinsics
---------------------------------

.. code-block:: llvm

    declare i8* @llvm.nacl.read.tp()

Returns the thread pointer, which can be set by the embedding sandbox's runtime.

.. _setjmplongjmp:

Setjmp and Longjmp
------------------

.. code-block:: llvm

    declare void @llvm.nacl.longjmp(i8* %jmpbuf, i32)
    declare i32 @llvm.nacl.setjmp(i8* %jmpbuf)

These intrinsics implement the semantics of C11 ``setjmp`` and ``longjmp``. The
``jmpbuf`` pointer must be 64-bit aligned and point to at least 1024 bytes of
allocated memory.

.. _atomicintrinsics:

Atomic intrinsics
-----------------

.. code-block:: llvm

    declare iN @llvm.nacl.atomic.load.<size>(
            iN* <source>, i32 <memory_order>)
    declare void @llvm.nacl.atomic.store.<size>(
            iN <operand>, iN* <destination>, i32 <memory_order>)
    declare iN @llvm.nacl.atomic.rmw.<size>(
            i32 <computation>, iN* <object>, iN <operand>, i32 <memory_order>)
    declare iN @llvm.nacl.atomic.cmpxchg.<size>(
            iN* <object>, iN <expected>, iN <desired>,
            i32 <memory_order_success>, i32 <memory_order_failure>)
    declare void @llvm.nacl.atomic.fence(i32 <memory_order>)

Each of these intrinsics is overloaded on the ``iN`` argument, which
is reflected through ``<size>`` in the overload's name. Integral types
of 8, 16, 32 and 64-bit width are supported for these arguments.

The ``@llvm.nacl.atomic.rmw`` intrinsic implements the following
read-modify-write operations, from the general and arithmetic sections
of the C11/C++11 standards:

 - ``add``
 - ``sub``
 - ``or``
 - ``and``
 - ``xor``
 - ``exchange``

For all of these read-modify-write operations, the returned value is
that at ``object`` before the computation. The ``computation``
argument must be a compile-time constant.

All atomic intrinsics also support C11/C++11 memory orderings, which
must be compile-time constants. Those are detailed in `Atomic Memory
Ordering Constraints`_.

Integer values for these computations and memory orderings are defined
in ``"llvm/IR/NaClAtomicIntrinsics.h"``.

.. note::

    These intrinsics allow PNaCl to support C11/C++11 style atomic
    operations as well as some legacy GCC-style ``__sync_*`` builtins
    while remaining stable as the LLVM codebase changes. The user
    isn't expected to use these intrinsics directly.
